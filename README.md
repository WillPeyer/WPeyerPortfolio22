# WPeyerPortfolio

Hi! My name is Will Peyer, and I'm a student at Eden Prairie High School, Minnesota. I first began my programming journey in AP Computer Science Principles in my Sophomore year. I learned the basics of programming languages and expanded my basic problem solving skills. Later, in my Junior year, I took AP CSA where I learned the fundimentals of Java. Now, I am in iOS App Development where I can create and upload applications to the Apple App Store. I am currently working on "Sky Skirmish", a bullet-hell type game.

## [Super Bird Fighter Ultra](https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/Super-Bird-Fighter-Ultra)

My specialty during the start of my iOS journey was with sprites and animation, something that has contributed well to the gameplay and aesthetics of my apps overall. My first animation set was based around a game named Chicken Fighter Ultra. It included various actions that a goose would perform, including walking, flying, and attacking. I also created sprites and animation for the boss chicken. That indcluded the egg that they shoot, and a crate for a mechanic that was never added. The program that I used to make all of these animations was Piskel, a free online sprite and animation maker.

## [Elmo's Revenge](https://github.com/WillPeyer/1MonthProject/tree/main)

A small project towards the end of the 2021 school year that I was a part of with two other partners was called "Elmo's Revenge". It's development journey was mainly used at a learning epericence for me and my two teammeates. My main role during the development was smoothing out the timing of the monster's spawning, and managing the score of the player after the game had ended.

## [Sky Skirmish](https://github.com/WillPeyer/SkySkirmish)

This was my biggest project to date. My second year in iOS app development has been where I really started to begin my iOS programming journey. I paired up with two other people to develop "Sky Skirmish", and you can check out the repository if you are interested. It's a simple bullet-hell type shooter with enemy flight paths and a helicopter that shoots at the player. It was a huge undertaking and I am very proud of the result.

## [Apple Finder](https://github.com/WillPeyer/Apple-Finder)

I first started coding in MIT App Inventor while I was in the class AP Computer Science Principles. I learned a lot in that class, and you can see my final project with the link above.

It is called "Apple Finder'', and its main use is to find and select your own personal apple. The user would insert their preferences into some sliders (i.e. sweetness, crispness, tartness), and the algorithm would find their perfect apple.
