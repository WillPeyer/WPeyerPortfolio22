My specialty during the start of my iOS journey was with sprites and animation, something that has contributed well to the gameplay and aesthetics of my apps overall. My first animation set was based around a game named Chicken Fighter Ultra. It included various actions that a goose would perform, including walking, flying, and attacking. I also created sprites and animation for the boss chicken. That indcluded the egg that they shoot, and a crate for a mechanic that was never added. The program that I used to make all of these animations was Piskel, a free online sprite and animation maker.

A small project towards the end of the 2021 school year that I was a part of with two other partners was called "Elmo's Revenge". It's development journey was mainly used at a learning epericence for me and my two teammeates. My main role during the development was smoothing out the timing of the monster's spawning, and managing the score of the player after the game had ended.

My second year in iOS app development has been where I really started to begin my iOS programming journey. I've paired up with two other people to develop "Sky Skirmish". You can check out the repository if you are interested.

I first started coding in MIT App Inventor while I was in the class AP Computer Science Principles. I learned a lot in that class, and you can see my final project with the link above.

It is called "Apple Finder'', and its main use is to find and select your own personal apple. The user would insert their preferences into some sliders (i.e. sweetness, crispness, tartness), and the algorithm would find their perfect apple.
